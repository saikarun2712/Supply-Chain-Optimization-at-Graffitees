## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing inventory management and profit distribution for Graffitees, a company that customizes T-shirts with graffiti art. By implementing data-driven strategies, the project aims to refine ordering processes, improve supply chain coordination, and establish more favorable terms with suppliers to maximize profitability.

## Background
Graffitees sources T-shirts from its supplier, KHG, and customizes them for resale. Each shirt incurs production, customization, and delivery costs, and unsold units are heavily discounted at the year’s end. Historically, Graffitees’ inventory management has been based on intuition rather than a systematic approach, leading to inefficiencies in meeting demand and profit-sharing disparities with the supplier.

## Project Goals
- **Data-Driven Inventory Management:** Transition from intuition-based ordering to an optimized, demand-driven approach.
- **Contract Renegotiation with Supplier (KHG):** Establish a balanced risk-reward model that benefits both Graffitees and KHG.

## Strategies

### Inventory Optimization
- **Demand Analysis:** Leverage historical data to determine optimal order quantities and frequencies, minimizing both excess stock and stockouts.
- **Cost Reduction:** Adjust order and inventory holding practices to lower fixed and variable costs, improving overall financial efficiency.

### Contract Renegotiation
- **Evaluate Current Contract:** Assess and update contract terms with KHG to better reflect each party’s contributions and risks.
- **Propose Alternative Models:** Consider options like buyback contracts or two-part tariffs to improve the flexibility and profitability of the partnership.

## Current Challenges
1. **Demand Uncertainty:** Over-reliance on intuition leads to frequent stockouts and lost sales opportunities.
2. **Profit Imbalance:** The current profit-sharing structure favors the supplier, reducing Graffitees’ overall profitability.
3. **Inventory Costs:** Holding excess inventory drives up costs without sufficiently meeting customer demand, impacting margins.

## Optimized Solutions
1. **Enhanced Order Quantities:** Determine ideal ordering quantities to satisfy demand while reducing stockouts and leftovers.
2. **Improved Service Levels:** Use calculated service levels to ensure that customer demand is met more consistently, reducing missed sales opportunities.
3. **Balanced Profit Distribution:** Implement contract adjustments that increase Graffitees' share of supply chain profits, aligning incentives for both parties.

## Contract Negotiation
Graffitees and KHG will explore new contract models to improve terms:
- **Buyback Contract:** Offers KHG the option to buy back unsold inventory, although this approach may not be feasible due to close margins.
- **Two-Part Tariff Contract:** Involves a lower variable cost with a fixed fee, allowing Graffitees to manage order frequency more flexibly and improve their profit share.

## Expected Outcomes
With optimized inventory management and renegotiated contract terms, Graffitees anticipates:
- **Operational Improvements:** Streamlined order processes, reduced holding costs, and improved demand fulfillment.
- **Financial Gains:** Increased profit margins and a more balanced profit distribution between Graffitees and KHG.
- **Enhanced Market Position:** Meeting customer demand more effectively and strengthening the overall supply chain.
